===================
Phoenix represents what we use at Connective DX for the basis of new projects. With a library of patterns ready at our fingertips, a powerful and flexible grid system, and a clean, modular organization, you don't need to reinvent the wheel. And you'll have more time to invent the next wheel.

# Documentation
Full documentation is available in the documentation directory.  It will require the setup and build processes below to be followed; additional instructions can be found on the documentation page once loaded.

**NOTE**: Optional parameters for functions and mixins are all passed in together as keys in a map as the last parameter for the function or mixin.  The documentation for these is sub-optimal, but [Sassdoc is working on a method for better documenting maps as parameters](https://github.com/SassDoc/sassdoc/issues/386).

# Setup
Once you've cloned or downloaded the project, you'll first need to install NodeJS.  It can be downloaded at http://nodejs.org/download/.  Once Node is installed, builds are done by executing a command file.

1. Navigate to Assets/src
2. The type and name of the command file is dependent on your platform and which build you need.
    * Windows - execute one of the .cmd files.  The builds are listed below.  
    * Mac OS - execute one of the .command files.  The builds are listed below.
    * **NOTE** - if you get an error when executing a build, make sure you have execute privileges on the file as well as the base build file in Assets/src/build.

# Builds

Each of the builds will compile the SCSS under Assets/src/css and place CSS, images, JavaScript, fonts, and markup templates into their respective folders under Assets/dist (or the root for markup templates).  These compiled files should never be edited and are ignored by the repository.  **All code editing must take place in Assets/src.**

### Development
The development build includes linting and debugging, but does not minify files so they are readable during development.
* Windows - execute build-dev.cmd.
* Mac OS - execute build-dev.command.

### Watch
The watch build will execute the development build and watch for file changes, automatically compiling your source code and reloading your browser if you have LiveReload installed.
* Windows - execute build-watch.cmd.
* Mac OS - execute build-watch.command.

### Production
The production build lints, concatenates, and minifies files.
* Windows - execute build-production.cmd.
* Mac OS - execute build-production.command.

# Node Packages

The Node packages defined in Phoenix are [shrinkwrapped](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/shrinkwrap) when we create a new release to make sure that builds are predictable no matter when they are executed.  If you want to add, change, or remove packages, make sure you also run `npm shrinkwrap --dev` in order to shrinkwrap the changes.

# Special Thanks
This project would not be possible without contributions from these open-source projects:
* [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/)
* [Gumby Framework](https://github.com/GumbyFramework/Gumby) - our grid system began as a fork of Gumby's grid system and has since morphed into the mobile-first grid system it is today
* [Responsive Tabs](https://github.com/petelove666/Responsive-Tabs)
* [Tipsy](https://github.com/jaz303/tipsy)
* [Fancybox](https://github.com/fancyapps/fancyBox)
