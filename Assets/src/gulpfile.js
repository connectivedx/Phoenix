			Tasks are a unit of work. At their simplest tasks act as a simple file copy from [paths] to [output] (maintaining relative paths).
			By adding a driver your can intercept the sources the task gets and do things to them before they get to the output.
			The task below illustrates all the options for a task:

		{
			driver: // [optional] this is the name of the driver to use. A driver is a file in /lib/drivers that transforms the task items (eg minification). Without a driver, the task becomes a file watch/copy.
			paths: // Required. Array of paths to include in the task. Globbing syntax is allowed. Paths are relative to this folder.
			base: // [optional] Overrides the base location for this task only (e.g. if path = ./css/foo and base = ./css, and you write to ./lol, the files from /css/foo will go in /lol/foo not /lol/css/foo)
			watchPaths: // [optional] Array of paths to watch when doing file watching. Note that only simple globs (foo/**) should be used or new and renamed files cannot be watched. A change to these files triggers the task being run.
			autoClean: // [optional] true/false. If true, the paths in the output directory will be deleted before we start the build.
			autoCleanPaths: // [optional] Array of path globs. This overrides the autoclean behavior and specifies exactly what to clean before build. These paths are relative to the OUTPUT directory.
			output: // [optional] Overrides the output location for this task only
